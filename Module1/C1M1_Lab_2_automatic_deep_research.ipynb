    "- How to define agents with specific roles and expertise\n",
    "- How to provide agents with tools to perform their tasks\n",

    "- How to assemble agents and tasks into a Crew, all using CrewAI\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "As a research consultant, you're constantly tasked with producing comprehensive reports on diverse topics for demanding clients. You need to build an automatic deep research solution that can rapidly gather, verify, and synthesize information from across the internet, delivering reliable, fact-checked reports that meet tight deadlines and exacting standards regardless of the subject matter. \n",

    "## General instructions\n",
    "In this lab you will be presented with a structure of the code, but you will need to complete some of it. \n",
