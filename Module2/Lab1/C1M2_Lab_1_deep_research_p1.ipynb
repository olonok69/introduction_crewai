    "Welcome to the first practice lab of this module! \n",
    "\n",
    "In the last module, you went through a very interesting use case of multi agent systems: building your custom deep research system. In this lab you will use what you have already built in Module 1, and add decision making tools, like execution hooks and guardrails, as well as memory to improve the reliability of your crew.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What you'll learn:**\n",
    "- How to add programmatic guardrails to make your multi agent system more robust\n",
    "- How to add execution hooks to inject logic after the agents run\n",
    "- How to add memory to your crew\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "As a research consultant, you're constantly tasked with producing comprehensive reports on diverse topics for demanding clients. You need to build an AI research crew that can rapidly gather, verify, and synthesize information from across the internet, delivering reliable, fact-checked reports that meet tight deadlines and exacting standards regardless of the subject matter.\n",
    "\n",
    "## General instructions\n",
    "In this lab you will be presented with a structure of the code, but you will need to complete some of it. \n",
    "\n",
    "To successfully run this lab, replace all instances of the placeholder `None` with your own code. Sections where you need to write code will be delimited between `### START CODE HERE ###` and `### END CODE HERE ###`.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are stuck, or simply want to copy a solution into your notebook so that you can execute it, you can find all solution code inside the [Solution](Solution) folder.\n",

These guardrails provide a way to validate and transform task outputs before they are passed to the next task, helping ensure data quality and providing feedback to agents when their output doesn't meet specific criteria. You can find out more about guardrails in the [docs](https://docs.crewai.com/en/concepts/tasks#task-guardrails).\n",

They help ensure quality and give feedback to agents when their work needs improvement.\n",

    "The guardrail functions must accept exactly one parameter (the task output they are reviewing), and should return a tuple of `(bool, Any)`. If the validation is successful, it returns a tuple of `(bool, Any)`. For example: (True, validated_result). If it fails, it needs to return a tuple of `(bool, str)`. For example: (False, \"Error message explaining the failure\"). For more information, you can check out the [docs](https://docs.crewai.com/en/concepts/tasks#task-guardrails).\n",
